		<h1> Submit Your Own Point of the Day</h1>
		<p>Everyone feels that what their saying is not pointless and POTD gives users a place to prove they have 
		something meaningful to say. Everyday we choose a Feautured POTD that is published on our home page. 
		These featured posts come from a combination of Points submitted by users and Points of the creators of this site.
		Every post submitted will be displayed and has a chance to be a Featured Point of the Day and appear in our popular page.
